# EternityEngine

**EternityEngine** is a simulation engine for building living, evolving fantasy worlds — inspired by *XianXia* cultivation novels and designed for long-term narrative emergence.

⚙️ Built as a modular, reusable open-source foundation, it allows the creation of characters, sects, realms, techniques, artifacts, and more — all progressing over time according to internal logic and customizable rules.

## 🧭 Vision

This project is not just a game. It's a **simulation foundation** for XianXia-inspired worlds — combining code-defined rules with AI storytelling.

📖 For full vision, world structure, and future plans — read [`VISION.md`](./docs/VISION.md)

## 🌱 What It Will Become

This is a long-term project, planned in stages:

1. **Simulation Core**: tick-based world logic, cultivation progress, event systems
2. **Narrator Integration**: LLM-powered text generation for immersion
3. **Playable Game**: CLI or web-based interaction with the world
4. **Framework for Others**: use EternityEngine to build your own world, your own rules, your own story

## 🔧 Tech Foundations

While the tech stack is still being decided, EternityEngine aims to be:

- Written in Python or TypeScript
- Modular and extensible
- Easy to fork, expand, and adapt

---

## 💡 Status

🧪 This project is in its **earliest concept stage**.  
The engine does not yet run — but the foundation is being carefully prepared.
